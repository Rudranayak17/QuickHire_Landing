        A labour management system is software, or other technological
        equipment businesses use to manage their workforces and streamline
        labour-related operations. It often has capabilities like payroll
        integration, labour forecasting, time and attendance tracking, employee
        scheduling, and performance monitoring. Putting in place a labour
        management system can boost productivity, increase employee happiness,
        and provide helpful information for calculating labour costs and making
        decisions.
